# P8139_GWAS

The Functional SNPs Associated with Muscle Size and Strength (FAMuSS) study was conducted to identify the genetic determinants of skeletal muscle size and strength before and after exercise training. A total of n = 1397 college student volunteers participated in the study, and data on 225 SNPs across multiple genes were collected. The exercise training involved students training their non-dominant arms for 12 weeks. The primary aim of the study was to identify genes associated with muscle performance and specifically to understand associations among SNPs and normal variation in volumetric MRI (muscle, bone, subQ fat), muscle strength, response to training and clinical markers of metabolic syndrome. Primary findings are given in Thompson et al. (2004). A complete list of associated publications can be found in the ReadMe file on the textbook webpage. The data are contained in a tab-delimited text file entitled FMS_data.csv. The file contains information on genotype across all SNPs as well as an extensive list of clinical and demographic factors for a subset (n = 1035) of the study participants.
